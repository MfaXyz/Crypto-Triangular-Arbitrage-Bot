# Crypto-Triangular-Arbitrage-Bot
The algorithm to calculate Triangular Arbitrage with depth on Centralized exchanges.

## Introduction
This algorithmic trading bot checks and detects arbitrage opportunities. This works on any Exchange with minor configuration. I'm just right now config script for kucoin exchange.

## Features
* Establish all traceable Triangular Arbitrage pairs unseen by others.
* Calculate surface rate opportunities across all pairs.
* Calculate real rates for arbitrage with depth.

## Setup & Guide
```
git clone https://github.com/MfaXyz/Crypto-Triangular-Arbitrage-Bot.git
Install Python!
set path of python https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows
and run python file: python main.py
```
for find structuring pairs your must uncomment these two lines:
```
coin_list = first_step()
structured_pairs = second_step(coin_list)
```
and comment last line:
```
while True:
    third_step()
```
after a while a json file named `structured_triangular_pairs.json` will create.

## Contributions & Further Improvement
**Feel free to contribute! You are so much welcome!**
We have huge problem in our code, ***execution part***, which is related to the execution of the transaction in the exchange, does not work properly and you will most likely lose money after its execution! I look forward to your commits to make this part profitable:)
