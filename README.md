This algorithmic trading bot checks and detects arbitrage opportunities. This works on any Exchange with minor configuration. I'm just right now config script for kucoin exchange.

## Features

for find structuring pairs your must uncomment these two lines and comment last line, after a while a json file named `structured_triangular_pairs.json` will create.

## Contributions & Further Improvement
**Feel free to contribute! You are so much welcome!**
We have huge problem in our code, ***execution part***, which is related to the execution of the transaction in the exchange, does not work properly and you will most likely lose money after its execution! I look forward to your commits to make this part profitable:)
